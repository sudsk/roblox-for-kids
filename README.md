### Step 1.4: First Look at Studio

When you open Roblox Studio, you'll see:

- **Start Page:** Shows recent projects and templates
- **Templates:** Pre-made starting points (we'll use "Baseplate")
- **Home Tab:** At the top, this is where basic tools live

**Don't worry if it looks complicated!** We'll use only a few simple tools.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Phase 2: Building the Starting Area

**Time: 30-40 minutes**  
**Goal:** Create the floor and spawn point where players start

### Step 2.1: Start a New Project

1. **In Roblox Studio's Start Page**, click **"Baseplate"** template
2. **Click** "Create" (or just double-click Baseplate)
3. **Wait** for the project to load (5-10 seconds)

You'll see:
- A large flat gray baseplate (the default floor)
- A green spawn point (where players appear)
- A bright blue sky

### Step 2.2: Delete the Default Spawn

We're going to make our own spawn point later!

1. **Look at the 3D view** (the big window showing the game world)
2. **Find** the green semi-transparent block (this is the SpawnLocation)
3. **Click** on it to select it (it will get a blue outline)
4. **Press** the `Delete` key on your keyboard

**Result:** The green spawn point disappears. Don't worry, we'll add a new one!

### Step 2.3: Create Your Main Floor

Now let's make the kitchen floor!

#### Creating the Part

1. **Look at the top toolbar**, find the **Home** tab
2. **Find** the **"Part"** button (it has a small cube icon)
3. **Click** "Part" (or press `Ctrl+P` on Windows, `‚åò+P` on Mac)

**Result:** A gray block appears in the middle of the screen!

#### Making It Bigger (Scaling)

1. **Make sure** the part is selected (blue outline around it)
2. **Find** the **Scale** tool in the toolbar (or press `R` key)
   - It looks like a small cube with arrows
3. **Click and drag** the round handles that appear on the block
   - Drag the handles outward to make it bigger
   - Make it approximately **50 x 1 x 50** studs
   - **The middle number (height) should be 1** to keep it flat like a floor

**üí° Tip:** Look at the bottom of Studio for exact measurements as you drag!

#### Moving It Into Position

1. **Select** the **Move** tool (or press `Ctrl+M` / `‚åò+M`)
   - It looks like crossed arrows
2. **Drag** the part down so it's sitting on top of the gray baseplate
3. **Use the colored arrows** to move it precisely:
   - **Red arrow** = Left/Right (X-axis)
   - **Green arrow** = Up/Down (Y-axis)
   - **Blue arrow** = Forward/Back (Z-axis)

### Step 2.4: Make It Look Like a Kitchen Floor

Now let's add color and texture!

#### Opening the Properties Window

1. **Make sure** your floor part is selected
2. **Look on the right side** of the screen for the **"Properties"** window
   - If you don't see it: Click **View** tab ‚Üí **Properties**

#### Changing the Color

1. **In the Properties window**, scroll down to find **"BrickColor"**
2. **Click** on the color box next to BrickColor
3. **Choose** a color like:
   - "White" (clean kitchen look)
   - "Light stone grey" (realistic floor)
   - "Institutional white" (bright and clean)

#### Changing the Material (Optional but Cool!)

1. **In Properties**, find **"Material"**
2. **Click** the dropdown menu
3. **Try** these materials:
   - **"Marble"** - shiny kitchen floor
   - **"Slate"** - stone tile look
   - **"Concrete"** - modern floor
   - **"SmoothPlastic"** - clean simple look

**üí° Experiment!** Try different combinations and see what looks best!

### Step 2.5: Add a Spawn Point

Players need somewhere to appear when they join!

1. **Click** the **Model** tab in the toolbar (top of screen)
2. **Find** and **click** the **"Spawn"** button
   - A green SpawnLocation appears in the world

#### Positioning the Spawn

1. **Select** the spawn point (click on it)
2. **Use the Move tool** (`Ctrl+M` / `‚åò+M`)
3. **Move it** onto your floor part
4. **Position it** near one edge (this is where players will start)

#### Making It Less Obvious

1. **Select** the spawn point
2. **In Properties**, find **"Transparency"**
3. **Change** the value to **0.5** (makes it semi-see-through)
4. **(Optional)** Find **"BrickColor"** and change it to match your floor

### Step 2.6: Test Your World!

Let's make sure everything works!

1. **Look at the top-left** of Studio
2. **Find** the **"Play"** button (‚ñ∂ icon) or press `F5`
3. **Click** Play

**What should happen:**
- Your character spawns on the green spawn point
- You can walk around on your floor
- Use **W A S D** keys to move
- Use your **mouse** to look around

**To stop testing:**
- Press the **Escape (Esc)** key, or
- Click the **"Stop"** button in the toolbar

### Step 2.7: Save Your Project

**IMPORTANT:** Save your work so you don't lose it!

1. **Click** File ‚Üí **"Save to Roblox"**
2. **Give your game a name:** "Escape the Giant's Kitchen"
3. **Add a description:** "Can you escape before the giant returns?"
4. **Click** "Save"

**üí° Good Practice:** Save every 5-10 minutes by pressing `Ctrl+S` (Windows) or `‚åò+S` (Mac)!

---

## üéØ Phase 3: Creating Your First 3 Obstacles

**Time: 45-60 minutes**  
**Goal:** Build three different types of obstacles that players must overcome

### Obstacle 1: The Jump Gap

**What it is:** Two platforms with a gap between them. Players must jump across!

#### Step 3.1.1: Create the First Platform

1. **Insert a new Part:** Click Part button (or `Ctrl+P` / `‚åò+P`)
2. **Scale it** to about **10 x 1 x 10** studs (a square platform)
   - Select it, press `R` for Scale tool
   - Drag handles to make it the right size
3. **Move it** forward from your spawn point
   - Press `Ctrl+M` / `‚åò+M` for Move tool
   - Use the blue arrow to move it forward
   - Position it about 5-10 studs away from spawn

#### Step 3.1.2: Change Its Color

1. **Select** the platform
2. **In Properties**, find **"BrickColor"**
3. **Choose** "Bright red" (or any color you like!)

**üí° Tip:** Using different colors for different obstacles helps players know what to expect!

#### Step 3.1.3: Create the Second Platform

1. **Select** your first platform
2. **Press** `Ctrl+D` (Windows) or `‚åò+D` (Mac) to duplicate it
   - Or right-click and choose "Duplicate"
3. **Move the duplicate** forward, leaving a GAP between them
   - Make the gap about **8-10 studs wide** (jumpable but challenging)

**Testing the Jump:**
- Press `F5` to test
- Try jumping across the gap
- Too easy? Make the gap wider
- Too hard? Make it smaller
- Press `Esc` to stop testing

### Obstacle 2: The Moving Platform (We'll Make It Move Later!)

**What it is:** A platform that moves back and forth. Players must time their jump!

#### Step 3.2.1: Create the Platform

1. **Insert** a new Part (`Ctrl+P` / `‚åò+P`)
2. **Scale** it to about **10 x 1 x 10** studs
3. **Move** it forward from your last platform
4. **Change its color** to "Bright blue" (so it's different)

**For now, we'll just place it.** In Phase 5, we'll add a script to make it move!

#### Step 3.2.2: Make Sure It's Anchored

This is important so the platform doesn't fall!

1. **Select** the platform
2. **In Properties**, find **"Anchored"**
3. **Make sure** the checkbox is **checked** (‚úì)

**What does "Anchored" mean?**
- Anchored = The part stays in place (doesn't fall or move from physics)
- Unanchored = The part falls down due to gravity

**All obstacles should be anchored!**

### Obstacle 3: The Disappearing Platform

**What it is:** Step on it, and it disappears! Teaches players about timing.

#### Step 3.3.1: Create the Platform

1. **Insert** a new Part
2. **Scale** it to about **8 x 1 x 8** studs (smaller = harder!)
3. **Move** it forward from your moving platform
4. **Change its color** to "Bright yellow"

#### Step 3.3.2: Make It Glow (Cool Effect!)

1. **Select** the platform
2. **In Properties**, find **"Material"**
3. **Change** it to **"Neon"**

**Result:** The platform will glow! This makes it look special and tells players "something different happens here."

#### Step 3.3.3: Important Settings

Make sure these are set correctly:

1. **Anchored:** ‚úì Checked
2. **CanCollide:** ‚úì Checked (so players can stand on it)
3. **Transparency:** 0 (fully visible)

We'll add the disappearing script in Phase 5!

### Step 3.4: Connect Everything

Now make sure players can reach each obstacle!

#### Create Connecting Platforms

Between each obstacle, you might need some "safe" platforms:

1. **Duplicate** (`Ctrl+D` / `‚åò+D`) a platform
2. **Move** it to fill gaps
3. **Use** a different color (like "Medium stone grey") for regular platforms

**üí° Design Tip:** 
- **Colored platforms** = Special obstacles
- **Gray platforms** = Safe resting spots

### Step 3.5: Test Your Obstacles

Press `F5` to test your course!

**What to check:**
- ‚úÖ Can you reach each obstacle from the previous one?
- ‚úÖ Are the jumps possible but challenging?
- ‚úÖ Do you spawn in the right place?
- ‚úÖ Are all platforms solid (not falling)?

**If something falls:** Select it and make sure **Anchored** is checked!

---

## üèÅ Phase 4: Adding Checkpoints

**Time: 20-30 minutes**  
**Goal:** Add checkpoints so players don't have to restart from the beginning every time they fall!

### Why Checkpoints Are Important

Nothing is more frustrating than falling near the end and starting all over! Checkpoints let players respawn at the last checkpoint they touched.

### Step 4.1: Understanding Checkpoints

In Roblox, checkpoints are special SpawnLocations with different **Team Colors**.

- **First spawn** = Default team (you already have this)
- **Checkpoint 1** = Different team color
- **Checkpoint 2** = Another different team color
- And so on...

### Step 4.2: Place Your First Checkpoint

#### Where to Put It

Place checkpoints after every **2-3 obstacles**. For our tutorial, put one after your three obstacles.

#### Creating the Checkpoint

1. **Click** the **Model** tab
2. **Click** the **"Spawn"** button
3. **A new spawn location** appears

#### Moving It Into Position

1. **Use** the Move tool (`Ctrl+M` / `‚åò+M`)
2. **Position** it on a safe platform after your obstacles
3. **Make sure** it's sitting flat on the platform

### Step 4.3: Configure the Checkpoint

Select the checkpoint and change these properties:

#### Change the Team Color

1. **In Properties**, find **"TeamColor"**
2. **Click** the dropdown
3. **Choose** a color (like "Bright blue")
   - Each checkpoint should be a DIFFERENT color!

#### Adjust Appearance

1. **"Transparency"** ‚Üí Set to **0.5** (semi-see-through)
2. **"CanCollide"** ‚Üí **Uncheck** this box (so players don't bump into it)

**Why turn off CanCollide?**
- Players can walk through it without getting stuck
- It still works as a checkpoint!

### Step 4.4: Add More Checkpoints

As you build more obstacles, add more checkpoints:

1. **Duplicate** your first checkpoint (`Ctrl+D` / `‚åò+D`)
2. **Move** it to the new position
3. **Change** the TeamColor to a NEW color
4. **Keep** Transparency at 0.5 and CanCollide unchecked

**üí° Checkpoint Pattern:**
- Start ‚Üí 3 obstacles ‚Üí Checkpoint 1
- Checkpoint 1 ‚Üí 3 obstacles ‚Üí Checkpoint 2
- Checkpoint 2 ‚Üí 3 obstacles ‚Üí Checkpoint 3
- And so on...

### Step 4.5: Optional - Add Checkpoint Signs

Make it clear where checkpoints are!

#### Create a Sign Part

1. **Insert** a Part
2. **Scale** it thin (like 5 x 3 x 0.2)
3. **Position** it above or behind the checkpoint
4. **Change** color to match the checkpoint

#### Add Text (Advanced - Skip if Too Hard)

1. **Select** the sign part
2. **Right-click** ‚Üí Insert Object ‚Üí **SurfaceGui**
3. **Right-click** the SurfaceGui ‚Üí Insert Object ‚Üí **TextLabel**
4. **Select** the TextLabel
5. **In Properties:**
   - "Text" ‚Üí Type "CHECKPOINT 1"
   - "TextSize" ‚Üí 48 (or bigger)
   - "Font" ‚Üí Choose something bold
   - "TextColor3" ‚Üí Choose a contrasting color

**Don't worry if this seems complicated!** Checkpoints work fine without signs. This is just to make them prettier.

### Step 4.6: Test Checkpoints

Time to test if they work!

1. **Press** `F5` to play
2. **Walk through** Checkpoint 1
3. **Jump off** the edge (let yourself die)
4. **You should respawn** at Checkpoint 1, not at the start!

**If you respawn at the start instead:**
- Make sure the checkpoint's **TeamColor** is DIFFERENT from the starting spawn
- Check that **"Enabled"** is checked in Properties
- Make sure you actually touched the checkpoint

---

## üíª Phase 5: Adding Scripts (Make It Interactive!)

**Time: 45-60 minutes**  
**Goal:** Make platforms disappear, move, and create a finish line!

### What Are Scripts?

Scripts are instructions that tell Roblox what to do. They're written in a language called **Lua** (pronounced "LOO-ah").

**Don't worry!** We'll explain every line of code.

### Important: Enable Code Assist (AI Helper)

Before we start coding, let's turn on Roblox's AI assistant!

1. **Click** File ‚Üí **Studio Settings**
2. **In the search box**, type "Code Assist"
3. **Find** "Script Editor" section
4. **Check** the box next to **"Code Assist Enabled"**
5. **Click** "Save"

**What does this do?**
- Code Assist suggests code as you type (like autocomplete on your phone)
- It helps prevent typos
- It's like having a coding tutor!

### Script 1: Disappearing Platform

Let's make that yellow platform disappear when you step on it!

#### Step 5.1.1: Add a Script to the Platform

1. **Select** your yellow disappearing platform (the one we made in Phase 3)
2. **Right-click** on it
3. **Choose** "Insert Object"
4. **Type** "Script" in the search box
5. **Click** "Script"

**Result:** A script appears inside the part in the Explorer window!

#### Step 5.1.2: Open the Script

1. **In the Explorer** (usually on the right side), find your platform
2. **Click the small arrow** next to it to expand
3. **Double-click** the "Script" inside it

**Result:** A new window opens showing the script!

#### Step 5.1.3: Delete the Default Code

You'll see some text like `print("Hello World!")`. 

1. **Select all** the text (`Ctrl+A` / `‚åò+A`)
2. **Press** Delete

Now you have a blank script!

#### Step 5.1.4: Type This Code

**Important:** Type it carefully! Lua is case-sensitive (capital letters matter).

```lua
local part = script.Parent
local transparency = part.Transparency
local canCollide = part.CanCollide

part.Touched:Connect(function(hit)
    if hit.Parent:FindFirstChild("Humanoid") then
        wait(0.5)  -- Wait half a second
        part.Transparency = 1  -- Make invisible
        part.CanCollide = false  -- Can't stand on it
        wait(3)  -- Wait 3 seconds
        part.Transparency = transparency  -- Make visible again
        part.CanCollide = canCollide  -- Can stand on it again
    end
end)
```

**üí° Tip:** Code Assist should help you! As you type, it suggests what comes next.

#### Step 5.1.5: Understanding the Code

Let's break down what each part does:

```lua
local part = script.Parent
```
- This finds the part the script is inside

```lua
local transparency = part.Transparency
local canCollide = part.CanCollide
```
- This remembers the original settings

```lua
part.Touched:Connect(function(hit)
```
- This runs code when something touches the part

```lua
if hit.Parent:FindFirstChild("Humanoid") then
```
- This checks if a player touched it (not just a random part)

```lua
wait(0.5)  -- Wait half a second
```
- Waits 0.5 seconds after the player touches it

```lua
part.Transparency = 1  -- Make invisible
```
- Makes the part invisible (1 = fully transparent)

```lua
part.CanCollide = false  -- Can't stand on it
```
- Makes it so you fall through it

```lua
wait(3)  -- Wait 3 seconds
```
- Waits 3 seconds

```lua
part.Transparency = transparency
part.CanCollide = canCollide
```
- Brings it back to normal!

#### Step 5.1.6: Test It!

1. **Close** the script window (click the X on its tab)
2. **Press** `F5` to test
3. **Walk onto** the yellow platform
4. **It should disappear** after you step on it!
5. **Wait 3 seconds** - it comes back!

**If it doesn't work, check:**
- Is the script inside the part? (Check Explorer)
- Did you type everything exactly as shown?
- Look at the **Output** window (View ‚Üí Output) for errors

### Script 2: Moving Platform

Now let's make that blue platform move back and forth!

#### Step 5.2.1: Add a Script

1. **Select** your blue moving platform
2. **Right-click** ‚Üí Insert Object ‚Üí Script
3. **Double-click** the script to open it
4. **Delete** the default code

#### Step 5.2.2: Type This Code

```lua
local part = script.Parent
local startPos = part.Position
local endPos = startPos + Vector3.new(20, 0, 0)  -- Moves 20 studs to the right
local speed = 2  -- Seconds to reach end

while true do
    -- Move to end position
    part:TweenPosition(endPos, "Out", "Sine", speed, true)
    wait(speed)
    -- Move back to start
    part:TweenPosition(startPos, "Out", "Sine", speed, true)
    wait(speed)
end
```

#### Step 5.2.3: Understanding the Code

```lua
local startPos = part.Position
```
- Remembers where the platform starts

```lua
local endPos = startPos + Vector3.new(20, 0, 0)
```
- Calculates where it should move to
- `Vector3.new(20, 0, 0)` means:
  - **20** studs to the RIGHT (X direction)
  - **0** studs up/down (Y direction)
  - **0** studs forward/back (Z direction)

```lua
local speed = 2
```
- How many seconds it takes to move

```lua
while true do
```
- Repeat forever

```lua
part:TweenPosition(endPos, "Out", "Sine", speed, true)
```
- Smoothly moves the platform to the end position

```lua
wait(speed)
```
- Waits for the movement to finish

**Customizing the Movement:**

Want to change the direction?

```lua
Vector3.new(20, 0, 0)   -- Right
Vector3.new(-20, 0, 0)  -- Left
Vector3.new(0, 10, 0)   -- Up
Vector3.new(0, -10, 0)  -- Down
Vector3.new(0, 0, 20)   -- Forward
Vector3.new(0, 0, -20)  -- Backward
```

Want to change the speed?

```lua
local speed = 1  -- Faster
local speed = 5  -- Slower
```

#### Step 5.2.4: Test It!

1. **Press** `F5` to play
2. **Watch** the blue platform move back and forth!

**Troubleshooting:**
- **Platform falls?** Make sure **Anchored** is checked!
- **Doesn't move?** Check the Output window for errors
- **Moves weird?** Adjust the numbers in Vector3.new()

### Script 3: Win Block (Finish Line!)

Let's create a finish line that congratulates players!

#### Step 5.3.1: Create the Win Block

1. **Insert** a Part
2. **Scale** it to about **15 x 15 x 1** (make it big and flat)
3. **Move** it to the end of your obby (stand it upright like a wall)
4. **Change color** to **"Bright green"**
5. **Change material** to **"Neon"** (makes it glow)

#### Step 5.3.2: Add the Script

1. **Right-click** the win block ‚Üí Insert Object ‚Üí Script
2. **Delete** default code
3. **Type** this:

```lua
local part = script.Parent

part.Touched:Connect(function(hit)
    local humanoid = hit.Parent:FindFirstChild("Humanoid")
    if humanoid then
        local player = game.Players:GetPlayerFromCharacter(hit.Parent)
        if player then
            -- Win message
            local message = Instance.new("Message")
            message.Text = player.Name .. " has escaped the kitchen!"
            message.Parent = workspace
            wait(3)
            message:Destroy()
        end
    end
end)
```

#### Step 5.3.3: Understanding the Code

```lua
local player = game.Players:GetPlayerFromCharacter(hit.Parent)
```
- Gets the player who touched the block

```lua
local message = Instance.new("Message")
```
- Creates a message object

```lua
message.Text = player.Name .. " has escaped the kitchen!"
```
- Sets what the message says
- `..` joins text together
- Shows the player's username

```lua
message.Parent = workspace
```
- Makes the message appear on screen

```lua
wait(3)
message:Destroy()
```
- Waits 3 seconds, then removes the message

#### Step 5.3.4: Test It!

1. **Press** `F5`
2. **Complete** the obby
3. **Touch** the green win block
4. **You should see** a message saying you escaped!

## üé® Phase 6: Making It Look Cool

**Time: 30-45 minutes**  
**Goal:** Add decorations and atmosphere to make your obby look like a giant's kitchen!

### Decorating Tips

Your obby works, but it's pretty plain! Let's make it look awesome.

### Step 6.1: Add Giant Kitchen Items

Use the **Toolbox** to find giant kitchen props!

#### Opening the Toolbox

1. **Click** View tab ‚Üí **Toolbox**
2. **A window appears** on the left side

#### Searching for Models

1. **In the Toolbox search box**, type:
   - "Kitchen"
   - "Cup"
   - "Plate"
   - "Utensils"
   - "Food"
2. **Click** on models you like
3. **They appear** in your workspace!

#### Making Them GIANT

1. **Select** the model (click on it)
2. **Press** `R` for the Scale tool
3. **Drag** the handles OUT to make it HUGE
4. **Position** it using the Move tool

**üí° Decoration Ideas:**
- Giant coffee mug next to the obby
- Huge spoon leaning against a wall

2. **Click** on it
3. **In Properties**, find **"ClockTime"**
4. **Try different times:**
   - `14` = Afternoon (bright)
   - `8` = Morning (soft light)
   - `18` = Evening (sunset colors)
   - `0` = Midnight (dark, spooky)

#### Add Atmosphere Effects

Still in Lighting properties:

1. **"Ambient"** ‚Üí Change the color to add a tint to shadows

2. **Right-click** ‚Üí Insert Object ‚Üí **ParticleEmitter**
3. **In Properties**, adjust:
   - **"Texture"** ‚Üí (try different particle textures)
   - **"Rate"** ‚Üí 50 (how many particles per second)
   - **"Color"** ‚Üí Make it gold or rainbow!
   - **"Lifetime"** ‚Üí NumberRange (1, 3) = particles last 1-3 seconds

**Other places to add particles:**

- Steam from a giant coffee mug
- Sparkles on checkpoints

### Step 6.6: Add Sound Effects (Optional)

Make your obby come alive with sound!

#### Background Music

1. **Find music** you like (search online for "royalty free game music" or use Roblox Audio Library)
2. **Get the Audio ID** from Roblox's library
3. **In Explorer**, right-click **Workspace**
4. **Insert Object** ‚Üí **Sound**
5. **In Properties**:
   - **"SoundId"** ‚Üí Paste the audio ID: `rbxassetid://[NUMBER]`

   - **"Volume"** ‚Üí 0.5 (not too loud)
   - **"Playing"** ‚Üí Check this (‚úì) to start it

#### Sound Effects for Actions

**Example: Add a sound when touching the win block**

Modify your win block script:

```lua
local part = script.Parent
local winSound = Instance.new("Sound")
winSound.SoundId = "rbxassetid://12345678"  -- Replace with your sound ID
winSound.Volume = 0.7
winSound.Parent = part

part.Touched:Connect(function(hit)
    local humanoid = hit.Parent:FindFirstChild("Humanoid")
    if humanoid then
        local player = game.Players:GetPlayerFromCharacter(hit.Parent)
        if player then
            -- Play sound
            winSound:Play()
            
            -- Win message
            local message = Instance.new("Message")
            message.Text = player.Name .. " has escaped the kitchen!"
            message.Parent = workspace
            wait(3)
            message:Destroy()
        end
    end
end)
```

**üí° Finding Sound IDs:**
- Search the Toolbox for "Sound"
- Look at the sound's properties to find the ID
- Or visit the Roblox Creator Marketplace online

### Step 6.7: Final Touches

#### Add a Starting Sign

1. **Create** a Part near the spawn
2. **Scale** it thin (like a sign)
3. **Add** a SurfaceGui with TextLabel (like we did for checkpoints)
4. **Text:** "Welcome to the Giant's Kitchen! Can you escape?"

#### Create Themed Sections

Divide your obby into "rooms":
- **Stovetop section** - hot red platforms, fire effects
- **Sink section** - blue platforms, water materials
- **Counter section** - wooden platforms
- **Refrigerator section** - cold blue/white theme

#### Add Danger Zones

Create "lava" or "kill" parts that reset you to the last checkpoint:

1. **Insert** a Part
2. **Scale** it to cover an area (like under platforms)
3. **Color** it red
4. **Material** ‚Üí Neon
5. **Add this script:**

```lua
local part = script.Parent

part.Touched:Connect(function(hit)
    local humanoid = hit.Parent:FindFirstChild("Humanoid")
    if humanoid then
        humanoid.Health = 0  -- Kills the player
    end
end)
```

**Place these:**
- Under platform sections (so falling = death)
- In obvious "danger" areas
- Makes the obby more challenging!

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Problems and Solutions

#### Problem: "My script doesn't work!"

**Solutions:**

1. **Check the Output window**
   - View ‚Üí Output
   - Look for red error messages
   - Read what the error says

2. **Common script errors:**
   - **"attempt to index nil"** = The script can't find something
     - Check: Is the script in the right place?
     - Check: Are you referencing the right object?
   
   - **"expected 'end' near <eof>"** = Missing "end" keyword
     - Count your "function" and "if" statements
     - Each needs a matching "end"
   
   - **Script does nothing** = Check these:
     - Is the script enabled? (Not disabled in properties)
     - Is it in the right parent object?
     - Did you save the script? (Ctrl+S)

3. **Copy the error message** and ask ChatGPT or Claude:
   - "I got this Roblox error: [paste error]"
   - "Here's my code: [paste code]"

#### Problem: "Parts keep falling through the floor!"

**Solutions:**

1. **Check if parts are anchored**
   - Select the part
   - Properties ‚Üí "Anchored" ‚Üí ‚úì Check it

2. **Make sure CanCollide is ON**
   - Properties ‚Üí "CanCollide" ‚Üí ‚úì Check it

3. **Check the floor**
   - Is the floor anchored?
   - Is the floor's CanCollide ON?

#### Problem: "Players spawn in the wrong place!"

**Solutions:**

1. **Check spawn location position**
   - Make sure it's ON TOP of a solid surface
   - Not floating in the air or underground

2. **Check spawn properties**
   - "Enabled" should be ‚úì checked
   - "CanCollide" should be unchecked
   - "Anchored" should be ‚úì checked

3. **Multiple spawns?**
   - First spawn = default team (no team color set)
   - Other spawns = must have DIFFERENT team colors

#### Problem: "Checkpoints don't work!"

**Solutions:**

1. **Each checkpoint needs a UNIQUE team color**
   - Checkpoint 1 = Bright blue
   - Checkpoint 2 = Bright red
   - Checkpoint 3 = Bright green
   - All DIFFERENT from each other!

2. **Check these properties:**
   - "Enabled" ‚Üí ‚úì Checked
   - "CanCollide" ‚Üí Unchecked (so you don't bump it)
   - "Transparency" ‚Üí 0.5 (optional, just for looks)

3. **Make sure you TOUCH the checkpoint**

#### Problem: "The game is too laggy/slow!"

**Solutions:**

1. **Reduce decorations**
   - Too many parts = lag
   - Use simple shapes instead of complex models

2. **Check part count**
   - View ‚Üí Stats
   - If you have 1000+ parts, that's too many
   - Combine parts or remove some

3. **Optimize scripts**
   - Don't use `wait()` in tight loops
   - Use `RunService.Heartbeat` instead of `while true do`

4. **Test on different settings**
   - Turn graphics down in Roblox settings
   - Close other programs while testing

#### Problem: "My game got deleted/disappeared!"

**Solutions:**

1. **Check your Creations**
   - Go to create.roblox.com
   - Check "My Creations"
   - Look in all tabs (games, places, etc.)

2. **Check if it's set to Private**
   - Game settings ‚Üí Access
   - Change from Private to Public

3. **Look for auto-saves**
   - File ‚Üí Recent Places
   - Studio auto-saves every few minutes

**üí° Prevention:** Save often! Press Ctrl+S every few minutes!

#### Problem: "Players say they can't find my game!"

**Solutions:**

1. **Make sure it's Public**
   - Game settings ‚Üí Access ‚Üí Public

- Don't need to understand everything
- Your presence = encouragement!

#### Celebrate Small Wins

- "You made your first part!"
- "The platform disappeared - you did it!"
- "I love that color choice!"
- Save screenshots of progress

#### When They Get Stuck

**Don't immediately give answers!** Instead:

1. **Ask guiding questions:**
   - "What have you tried so far?"
   - "Where do you think the problem might be?"
   - "What does the error message say?"

2. **Encourage problem-solving:**
   - "Let's look at the tutorial together"
   - "Want to ask ChatGPT for help?"
   - "Should we search YouTube for this?"

3. **Know when to help:**
   - If stuck for 10+ minutes = offer help
   - If frustrated/upset = take a break
   - If completely lost = work through it together

#### Set Healthy Boundaries

**Recommended schedule:**
- **Sessions:** 20-30 minutes for young kids, 45-60 for older
- **Frequency:** 3-4 times per week
- **Breaks:** Every 30 minutes, step away from screen
- **Bedtime:** Stop 1 hour before bed (blue light affects sleep)

#### Safety Guidelines

1. **Monitor online interactions**
   - Roblox has chat filters for under-13
   - Still review who they talk to
   - Use privacy settings

2. **Set spending limits**
   - Robux can add up quickly
   - Set allowances/budgets
   - Teach money management
