   - **Type your password**
   - **Click "Log In"** or press Enter

**üéâ Success! Roblox Studio is ready!**

---

### Step 3: Understanding What You See

When Roblox Studio opens, don't panic! It looks complicated but it's actually simple.

#### The Main Screen - What Everything Is:

Let me describe what's on your screen right now:

**1. The Start Page (Middle of Screen):**
- Shows different "templates" (starting points for games)
- You'll see pictures with names like:
  - **"Baseplate"** - An empty flat world (we'll use this!)
  - "Flat Terrain" - Another empty world
  - "Racing" - A pre-made racing game
  - "Village" - A pre-made village

**2. The Top Bar (Very Top):**
- Says "Roblox Studio" on the left
- Has buttons like "File," "Home," "Model," "Test," "View"
- **Don't click anything yet!** We'll learn these later.

**3. Recent Places (If you've used Studio before):**
- Shows games you worked on before
- If this is your first time, you won't see any

---

### Step 4: Start Your First Project!

Now let's actually make something!

#### What To Do:

1. **Find the picture labeled "Baseplate"**
   - It looks like a flat gray square
   - It might say "Baseplate" or "Flat World" underneath

2. **Click on "Baseplate"** ONE time

3. **A window might pop up asking:**
   - "Create a new place from template?"
   - **Click "Create"** or "Yes"

4. **Wait about 5-10 seconds** while it loads

5. **YOU'RE IN!** You should now see:
   - A big gray flat surface (this is your "baseplate")
   - Blue sky all around
   - A green semi-transparent block on the baseplate (this is a "spawn point")

**What you're looking at:** This is YOUR game world! Right now it's empty, but we're going to fill it with fun stuff!

---

### Step 5: Learning How to Look Around

Before we build anything, you need to learn how to move the camera (look around).

#### Moving the Camera:

**Method 1: Using Your Mouse**

1. **Put your mouse pointer** in the middle of the screen (on the gray baseplate)

2. **Hold down the RIGHT mouse button** (not left, RIGHT!)
   - Keep holding it down

3. **While holding the RIGHT button, move your mouse around**
   - Your view spins! Cool, right?

4. **Let go** of the mouse button to stop spinning

**Method 2: Using Keyboard + Mouse Together** (This is how pros do it!)

1. **Hold down the RIGHT mouse button** again

2. **While holding it, press these keys:**
   - **W** = Move forward (into the screen)
   - **S** = Move backward (toward you)
   - **A** = Move left
   - **D** = Move right
   - **Q** = Move down (toward the ground)
   - **E** = Move up (into the sky)

3. **Practice moving around!**
   - Try to fly up high and look down
   - Try to go down low and look at the baseplate close-up
   - Don't worry, you can't break anything!

**Zooming In and Out:**
- **Scroll wheel** on your mouse:
  - Roll forward = zoom in (get closer)
  - Roll backward = zoom out (get farther away)

**üí° Pro Tip:** Spend 2-3 minutes just flying around and getting comfortable. This is really important!

---

### Step 6: Save Your Project (Don't Lose Your Work!)

Let's save this RIGHT NOW before we forget!

#### How To Save:

1. **Look at the very top-left** of your screen

2. **Click "File"**
   - A menu drops down

3. **Click "Save to Roblox"**
   - Sometimes it says "Publish to Roblox" instead - that's okay too!

4. **A window pops up.** Fill it in:

   **Name:**
   - Type: `Escape the Giants Kitchen`
   - (Or any name you like!)

   **Description:**
   - Type: `My first Roblox game where you escape from a giant kitchen!`

5. **Click the big "Save" button** at the bottom

6. **Wait 5-10 seconds** while it saves

**üéâ Saved!** Your game is now stored on Roblox's servers. Even if your computer crashes, it's safe!

**Important Habit:** Press `Ctrl + S` (Windows) or `Command + S` (Mac) every few minutes to save!

---

## üèóÔ∏è PHASE 2: Building Your First Platform

**Time Needed:** 30-40 minutes

Now the fun begins - building stuff!

### Step 1: Understanding What We're Building

We're going to make a kitchen floor where players start. Think of it like the floor in your real kitchen, but HUGE because you're tiny!

---

### Step 2: Delete the Green Spawn Point (For Now)

That green see-through block needs to go. We'll make a new one later!

#### What To Do:

1. **Look at your screen** - do you see the green transparent block sitting on the gray baseplate?

2. **Click on the green block** ONE time
   - When you click it, a BLUE outline appears around it
   - This means it's "selected" (you picked it)

3. **Press the Delete key** on your keyboard
   - It's the key that says "Delete" or "Del"
   - Usually near the top-right of your keyboard

4. **The green block disappears!** Perfect!

**Why we did this:** We're going to make our own spawn point later in a better place.

---

### Step 3: Make Your First Block (This Will Be Your Floor!)

Now let's create something new!

#### What To Do:

1. **Look at the very top** of Roblox Studio

2. **Find the "Home" tab**
   - It's near the top-left
   - If you don't see colorful buttons, click "Home"

3. **Look for a button that says "Part"**
   - It has a little cube icon on it
   - It's usually near the left side of the Home tab
   - **Click "Part"** ONE time

4. **BOOM! A gray block appears!**
   - It's floating in the middle of your screen
   - It's kind of small right now

**üéâ You just created your first object! This is called a "Part" - it's the building block of everything in Roblox!**

**üí° Quick Keyboard Shortcut:** Instead of clicking "Part," you can press `Ctrl + P` (Windows) or `Command + P` (Mac) to create parts faster!

---

### Step 4: Make It BIGGER (Create Your Floor!)

That block is too small to be a floor. Let's make it BIG!

#### Understanding the Tools:

First, let's find the tools at the top. You'll see buttons with icons:

- **Select** (cursor arrow) - For clicking things
- **Move** (four arrows pointing out) - For moving things
- **Scale** (small square) - For making things bigger or smaller
- **Rotate** (curved arrow) - For spinning things

#### Making It Bigger:

1. **Make sure your block is selected** (has blue outline)
   - If not, click on it

2. **Find the "Scale" tool** at the top
   - It looks like a small box/square
   - OR press the **R key** on your keyboard (faster way!)

3. **Look at your block** - now it has round white balls (handles) on its corners and sides

4. **Click and HOLD** on one of the round white balls

5. **Drag your mouse OUTWARD** (away from the block)
   - The block gets bigger!
   - Try to make it about **50 studs wide**

**What's a stud?** It's Roblox's way of measuring. One stud is about as long as a Lego brick!

#### The Right Size:

Let's make it the perfect size for a floor:

1. **Keep the Scale tool selected** (press R if needed)

2. **Watch the bottom of your screen** as you drag
   - You'll see numbers appear: "Size: X, Y, Z"
   - **X** = Width (left to right)
   - **Y** = Height (up and down)  
   - **Z** = Length (forward and back)

3. **Make it LONG so obstacles can fit:**
   - Drag the handles until you see something like: "Size: 50, 1, 150"
   - **Width: 50** studs (left to right)
   - **Height: 1** stud (keeps it flat!)
   - **Length: 150** studs (forward and back) - This is IMPORTANT! Needs to be long!

**Why 150 studs long?**
- Each obstacle platform is about 10 studs
- Gaps between platforms are about 10 studs
- We need space for: Spawn + 3 obstacles + gaps + checkpoint + win block
- 150 studs gives us plenty of room!

**üí° How to read the size numbers at the bottom:**
- As you drag the white balls, numbers update at the bottom
- They look like: **Size: 50, 1, 150**
- **First number (50)**: Width - can be 40-60, doesn't matter much
- **Middle number (1)**: Height - MUST be 1 to stay flat!
- **Last number (150)**: Length - needs to be 100-200 for obstacles to fit!

**üí° Tips:**
- Don't worry about being exactly perfect!
- Width can be 40-60 studs (doesn't matter much)
- Height MUST be **1** (flat floor)
- **Length is the important one - make it 100-200 studs!**
- If you make it too short, obstacles won't fit!
- You can always change it later!

---

### Step 5: Move It Down to the Baseplate

Your floor is probably floating in the air. Let's put it on the ground!

#### What To Do:

1. **Press M** on your keyboard OR click the **Move tool** (four arrows) at the top

2. **Your block now has colored arrows** on it:
   - **Red arrow** = moves left and right (X direction)
   - **Green arrow** = moves up and down (Y direction)
   - **Blue arrow** = moves forward and back (Z direction)

3. **Click on the GREEN arrow** (the one pointing up)

4. **HOLD the mouse button** and **drag DOWN**
   - Your block moves down!
   - Keep dragging until it's sitting RIGHT ON TOP of the gray baseplate
   - It should look like it's resting flat on the ground

**How do you know it's in the right place?**
- Your block should be touching the baseplate
- There should be no gap underneath it
- It should look like a platform sitting on the ground

**üí° If you mess up:** Just keep using the Move tool until it looks right! You can't break anything!

---

### Step 6: Make It Look Like a Kitchen Floor!

Right now it's just boring gray. Let's make it look better!

#### Finding the Properties Window:

1. **Look at the RIGHT side of your screen**

2. **Do you see a window that says "Properties" at the top?**
   - **YES?** Great! Skip to "Changing the Color" below
   - **NO?** Let's open it:
     - Click "View" at the very top
     - Click "Properties"
     - A window appears on the right!

#### Changing the Color:

1. **Click on your floor block** to select it (if it's not already selected)

2. **In the Properties window** (on the right), **scroll down** until you see **"BrickColor"**
   - It's in alphabetical order, so it's near the top

3. **Click on the colored box** next to "BrickColor"
   - A color picker appears - so many colors!

4. **Choose a color for your kitchen floor:**
   - **White** - Clean kitchen look
   - **Light stone grey** - Realistic floor
   - **Institutional white** - Super bright and clean
   - **Medium stone grey** - Modern floor
   - **Pick whatever you like!**

5. **Click on your choice**
   - Your floor changes color instantly!

#### Making It Look Even Cooler (Optional But Fun!):

Let's change the material to make it look more real!

1. **In Properties**, **scroll down** to find **"Material"**
   - It's also in alphabetical order

2. **Click on the dropdown** next to Material
   - You'll see a list: Plastic, Wood, Metal, etc.

3. **Try these materials:**
   - **Marble** - Shiny, fancy kitchen floor
   - **Slate** - Stone tile look
   - **Concrete** - Industrial style
   - **Wood Planks** - Wooden floor
   - **Smooth Plastic** - Simple and clean

4. **Pick one you like!**
   - Your floor's texture changes!
   - Try a few to see which looks best!

**üéâ Awesome! You now have a cool-looking kitchen floor!**

---

### Step 7: Make Sure It Stays In Place

We need to "anchor" the floor so it doesn't fall!

#### What To Do:

1. **Select your floor** (click on it)

2. **In Properties** (right side), **scroll to find "Anchored"**

3. **You'll see a checkbox** next to "Anchored"

4. **Make sure there's a CHECK MARK (‚úì) in the box**
   - **If there IS a checkmark:** Perfect! Leave it!
   - **If there's NO checkmark:** Click in the box to add one!

**Why is this important?** 
- "Anchored" means the block stays frozen in place
- If NOT anchored, it will fall down due to gravity!
- ALL platforms need to be anchored!

---

### Step 8: Add a Spawn Point (Where Players Appear!)

Now we need to tell Roblox where players should appear when they join the game.

#### What To Do:

1. **Look at the very top tabs** and **click "Model"**
   - It's next to "Home"

2. **Look for a button that says "Spawn"**
   - It might have a little icon of a person or flag
   - **Click it!**

3. **A green transparent block appears!**
   - This is your spawn point!

4. **Use the Move tool** (press M) to **move the spawn onto your floor**
   - Click and drag the GREEN arrow to move it up or down
   - Position it so it's sitting ON TOP of your floor
   - Put it near one edge of the floor (not in the middle)

**Why near the edge?**
- Players will spawn here and jump forward to start the obby
- It's better to have them start at one end!

#### Making It Look Less Ugly (Optional):

1. **Click on the spawn point** to select it

2. **In Properties**, find **"Transparency"**

3. **Change the number to 0.5**
   - This makes it half see-through
   - Not as bright and obvious!

4. **(Optional)** Change **"BrickColor"** to match your floor

---

### Step 9: TEST IT! (The Most Fun Part!)

Let's see if it works!

#### How To Play Your Game:

1. **Look at the TOP-LEFT** corner of Studio

2. **Find a big PLAY button** (‚ñ∂ triangle icon)
   - It might say "Play" next to it

3. **Click the PLAY button!**

**What happens:**
- Your screen changes!
- You become a character (your avatar) in the game!
- You spawn on the green spawn point!

#### Controls In The Game:

- **W** = Walk forward
- **S** = Walk backward  
- **A** = Walk left
- **D** = Walk right
- **Space Bar** = Jump!
- **Move your mouse** = Look around

#### Try These Things:

- Walk around on your floor
- Jump (press Space Bar)
- Look around (move your mouse)
- Try to walk off the edge (you'll fall - that's okay!)

**When you're done testing:**
- Press the **Escape key (Esc)** on your keyboard
- OR click the **Stop button** (‚ñ† square icon) at the top

**You're back in Studio!**

**üéâ CONGRATULATIONS! You just tested your first Roblox creation!**

---

### Step 10: Save Your Work (IMPORTANT!)

Don't lose what you made!

#### Quick Save:

**Press:** `Ctrl + S` (Windows) or `Command + S` (Mac)

That's it! It saves instantly!

**üí° Make this a habit:** Every time you make something cool, press Ctrl+S!

---

## üéØ PHASE 3: Building Fun Obstacles!

**Time Needed:** 45-60 minutes

Now let's make the fun part - obstacles players must jump across!

### What Are We Building?

We're making THREE different types of obstacles:

1. **Jump Gap** - Two platforms with a space between them (players must JUMP!)
2. **Moving Platform** - A platform that moves back and forth (tricky!)
3. **Disappearing Platform** - A platform that vanishes when you step on it (surprise!)

### Visual Guide - How It Should Look

Here's a bird's eye view (looking down from above) of what we're building:

```

```

**What you're building:** A straight path with obstacles going forward!

Let's start building!

---

### OBSTACLE #1: The Jump Gap

This is two platforms with a gap between them. Players have to jump across!

#### Step 1: Make the First Platform

1. **Press Ctrl+P** (or Command+P) to create a new Part

2. **A gray block appears**

3. **Press R** to get the Scale tool

4. **Make it smaller** than your main floor:
   - **Look at the bottom of your screen** while dragging
   - Drag the white ball handles
   - **Try to get the numbers to show: "10, 1, 10"**
   - First number = Width (10)
   - Middle number = Height (1) - keep this at 1!
   - Last number = Length (10)

**How to measure 10 x 1 x 10:**
- Click and drag a white ball
- **Watch the bottom of the screen**
- Numbers update as you drag: "Size: 10, 1, 10"
- Get close to those numbers - doesn't have to be exact!

5. **Press M** to get the Move tool

6. **Move it forward** from your spawn point:
   - Use the BLUE arrow (it moves things forward/backward)
   - Drag it forward until there's space between spawn and platform
   - About the length of 1-2 of your platforms is good
   - Don't worry about exact distance - just eyeball it!

**üí° Tip:** If you can't see it well, **zoom out** with your mouse wheel!

#### Step 2: Change Its Color

Let's make it red so players know it's an obstacle!

1. **Click on the platform** to select it

2. **In Properties**, find **"BrickColor"**

3. **Click the color box** and choose **"Bright red"**

**Why red?** It stands out and tells players "Hey! This is important!"

#### Step 3: Anchor It!

1. **Still in Properties**, find **"Anchored"**

2. **Make sure the box is CHECKED (‚úì)**

**Remember:** ALL obstacles must be anchored or they'll fall!

#### Step 4: Make a Second Platform (The Other Side)

Now we need another platform to jump TO!

1. **Click on your red platform** to select it

2. **Press Ctrl+D** (Windows) or **Command+D** (Mac)
   - **"D" stands for Duplicate** - it makes a copy!

3. **A perfect copy appears!**

4. **Press M** for Move tool

5. **Use the BLUE arrow** to drag it forward

6. **IMPORTANT:** Leave a GAP between the two platforms!
   - The gap should be about **8-10 studs wide**
   - Not too small (too easy)
   - Not too big (impossible!)

**How to check the gap size:**

Look at your obstacles from the side. They should look like this:

```
SIDE VIEW OF JUMP GAP:

     Player
       üë§
        ‚Üì
    ‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê         ‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
    ‚îÇ RED  ‚îÇ  (gap)  ‚îÇ RED  ‚îÇ
    ‚îÇ  1   ‚îÇ <‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ> ‚îÇ  2   ‚îÇ
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò         ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
    
    ‚Üë                ‚Üë
    Start here      Land here
    
GAP should be about THIS WIDE: ‚Üê‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí
(2-3 character widths when you test)
```

**Testing the jump visually:**

```
When you test (Press F5):

TOO EASY (gap too small):
   üë§
   ‚Üì_‚Üì  ‚Üê Can walk across, no jump needed
  [  ][  ]

JUST RIGHT:
   üë§
    ‚Üì‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí  ‚Üê Need to run and jump!
  [  ] (gap) [  ]

TOO HARD (gap too big):
   üë§
    ‚Üì‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí ‚ùå ‚Üê Can't reach!
  [  ]   (gap)     [  ]
```

#### Step 5: Test The Jump!

Let's see if players can make the jump!

1. **Click Play** (‚ñ∂ button at top-left)

2. **When you spawn**, walk forward

3. **Try to JUMP across the gap!**
   - Run forward (hold W)
   - Press Space Bar RIGHT before the edge
   - Did you make it?

**Adjust if needed:**
- **Too easy?** Make the gap wider! (Move platforms farther apart)
- **Too hard?** Make the gap smaller! (Move platforms closer)
- **Just right?** Perfect! Move on!

4. **Press Escape** to stop testing

**üéâ You made your first obstacle!**

---

### OBSTACLE #2: The Moving Platform

This platform moves back and forth! Players must time their jump perfectly!

**Note:** Right now we'll just BUILD it. In Phase 5, we'll add code to make it MOVE!

#### Step 1: Make the Platform

1. **Press Ctrl+P** (Command+P) to make a new Part

2. **Press R** for Scale tool

3. **Make it 10 x 1 x 10** (same size as your jump platforms)

4. **Press M** for Move tool

5. **Move it forward** from your last red platform
   - Put it a reasonable jump away
   - Make sure players can jump from red platform to this one

#### Step 2: Make It Blue

1. **Select the platform**

2. **In Properties**, change **"BrickColor"** to **"Bright blue"**

**Why blue?** So players know it's different from the red jumping platforms!

#### Step 3: Anchor It

1. **In Properties**, check **"Anchored"** ‚úì

**Don't worry** - in Phase 5 we'll make it move with code! For now, it just sits there.

**üéâ Platform created! We'll make it move later!**

---

### OBSTACLE #3: The Disappearing Platform

This platform will disappear when you step on it! (We'll add that magic in Phase 5)

#### Step 1: Make the Platform

1. **Press Ctrl+P** (Command+P) for a new Part

2. **Press R** to Scale

3. **Make it SMALLER** than the others:
   - Make it about **8 x 1 x 8**
   - Smaller = harder! Players have less room to land on!

4. **Press M** to Move

5. **Position it** forward from your blue platform

#### Step 2: Make It Yellow and Glowy!

1. **Select the platform**

2. **In Properties**, change **"BrickColor"** to **"Bright yellow"**

3. **Still in Properties**, find **"Material"**

4. **Change Material to "Neon"**
   - **BOOM!** It glows now!
   - This tells players "Something special happens here!"

#### Step 3: Anchor It

1. **Check the "Anchored" box** ‚úì in Properties

#### Step 4: Check CanCollide

We need to make sure players can stand on it (for now)!

1. **In Properties**, find **"CanCollide"**

2. **Make sure it's CHECKED** ‚úì

**Later we'll make it disappear with code, but for now it needs to be solid!**

**üéâ Third obstacle done!**

---

### Step 4: Connect Everything

Now let's make sure players can reach each obstacle!

```
CHECK YOUR LAYOUT - Does it look like this?

SIDE VIEW:
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê    ‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê (gap) ‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê    ‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê    ‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê    [C]    ‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇSTART‚îÇ ‚Üí  ‚îÇRED ‚îÇ       ‚îÇRED ‚îÇ ‚Üí  ‚îÇBLUE ‚îÇ ‚Üí  ‚îÇYELLOW‚îÇ ‚Üí  ‚îÇCP  ‚îÇ ‚Üí ‚îÇWIN! ‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò

ALL PLATFORMS SHOULD BE:
‚úì At about the same height (so you can jump between them)
‚úì Reachable from the previous one
‚úì Not too far apart (test by playing!)
```

#### Add Connecting Platforms (If Needed)

Look at your obstacles:
- Can players jump from one to the next?
- Are any gaps too big?

**If yes - you're good!**

**If no - add "bridge" platforms:**

1. **Make a new Part** (Ctrl+P)

2. **Scale it** to about 10 x 1 x 10

3. **Change color** to something neutral like **"Medium stone grey"**
   - Gray = safe resting spot
   - Bright colors = special obstacles

4. **Move it** between obstacles where needed

5. **Don't forget to Anchor it!** ‚úì

```
EXAMPLE - Adding a bridge platform:

BEFORE (too far apart):
[RED] ‚Üê‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ big gap ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí [BLUE]
        ‚ùå Can't jump this!

AFTER (added gray bridge):
[RED] ‚Üê small gap ‚Üí [GRAY] ‚Üê small gap ‚Üí [BLUE]
                     ‚Üë
              Safe bridge!
```

**üí° Design Tip:**
- **Bright colors** (red, blue, yellow) = Special/challenging
- **Gray/neutral colors** = Safe places to rest

---

### Step 5: Test Your Whole Course!

Time to play your game!

1. **Click Play** (‚ñ∂)

2. **Try to complete all three obstacles:**
   - Jump the gap (red platforms)
   - Jump to the blue platform (doesn't move yet)
   - Jump to the yellow platform (doesn't disappear yet)

3. **Make sure:**
   - ‚úÖ You can reach each one
   - ‚úÖ Nothing falls down
   - ‚úÖ Jumps are possible but challenging
   - ‚úÖ Everything is anchored properly

4. **Press Escape** when done

**If something falls down:**
- Click on it (you can find it in the Explorer window on the right)
- In Properties, check "Anchored" ‚úì

**üéâ You now have a working obstacle course! Next we'll make it even cooler with code!**

---

### Step 6: Save Again!

**Press Ctrl+S** (Command+S) to save your progress!

---

## üèÅ PHASE 4: Adding Checkpoints

**Time Needed:** 20-30 minutes

Checkpoints let players respawn at a certain point instead of starting all over! This is super important!

### Why Checkpoints?

Imagine: You complete 10 obstacles, then fall. Would you want to start from the beginning? NO WAY! 

Checkpoints save your progress!

---

### Understanding How Checkpoints Work

In Roblox:
- Each checkpoint is a **Spawn Location** (like the green one you made)
- Each checkpoint has a different **Team Color**
- When you touch a checkpoint, you join that "team"
- If you die/fall, you respawn at your team's spawn!

**Simple version:** Different colored spawns = different respawn points!

---

### Step 1: Where To Put Checkpoints

**Rule of thumb:** Put a checkpoint after every 2-3 obstacles!

For our game so far, we have 3 obstacles, so let's put one checkpoint at the end!

---

### Step 2: Make Your First Checkpoint

#### Creating It:

1. **Click the "Model" tab** at the top

2. **Click "Spawn"** button
   - A green spawn location appears!

3. **Press M** for Move tool

4. **Move it** to a safe spot after your three obstacles
   - Put it on a platform (or make a new safe platform for it)
   - Make sure it's sitting flat

**üí° Tip:** You might want to make a new gray platform for the checkpoint to sit on!

#### Making It Look Right:

1. **Select the checkpoint** (click on it)

2. **In Properties**, change these things:

   **"TeamColor":**
   - Click the dropdown
   - Choose **"Bright blue"** (or any color DIFFERENT from others)
   - **IMPORTANT:** Each checkpoint needs a UNIQUE color!

   **"Transparency":**
   - Change to **0.5**
   - This makes it half see-through (looks nicer)

   **"CanCollide":**
   - **UNCHECK this box** (no ‚úì)
   - This lets players walk THROUGH it
   - They won't get stuck on it!

---

### Step 3: Test the Checkpoint!

Does it work?

1. **Click Play** (‚ñ∂)

2. **Walk through your checkpoint**
   - Walk right through the semi-transparent spawn

3. **Jump off the edge** (let yourself fall and die)

4. **What happens?**
   - **If you respawn at the checkpoint:** SUCCESS! It works!
   - **If you respawn at the start:** Something's wrong - let's fix it!

5. **Press Escape** to stop

#### If It Didn't Work:

**Problem:** Respawning at start instead of checkpoint?

**Solution:**
1. Select your checkpoint
2. In Properties, check:
   - **"Enabled"** is CHECKED ‚úì
   - **"TeamColor"** is DIFFERENT from your starting spawn
   - **"Neutral"** is UNCHECKED (no ‚úì)

**Common Mistake:** If the checkpoint and starting spawn have the SAME color, it won't work!

---

### Step 4: Add More Checkpoints (Later)

As you add more obstacles, add more checkpoints!

**To make another checkpoint:**

1. **Select your first checkpoint**

2. **Press Ctrl+D** (Command+D) to duplicate

3. **Move it** to a new location

4. **Change its TeamColor** to something DIFFERENT
   - First checkpoint = Bright blue
   - Second checkpoint = Bright red
   - Third checkpoint = Bright green
   - **All must be DIFFERENT!**

**üéâ Checkpoints done! Now players won't rage quit when they fall!**

---

## üíª PHASE 5: Making Things Move and Disappear (CODING TIME!)

**Time Needed:** 45-60 minutes

This is where the MAGIC happens! We're going to write CODE to make things interactive!

**Don't worry if you've never coded before!** I'll explain every single step!

---

### What Is Code?

Code is instructions you write that tell the computer what to do!

Think of it like a recipe:
- Recipe says: "Crack 2 eggs"
- Code says: "When player touches platform, make it disappear"

In Roblox, we write code in a language called **Lua** (say "LOO-ah").

---

### Step 0: Turn On Code Helper (AI Assistant)

Roblox has a built-in helper that suggests code as you type! Let's turn it on!

#### What To Do:

1. **Click "File"** at the very top-left

2. **Click "Studio Settings"**
   - A big window with lots of options opens

3. **In the search box** at the top of this window, type: `code assist`

4. **Look for "Code Assist"** in the results

5. **Find a checkbox** that says something like "Enable Code Assist" or "Code Assist Enabled"

6. **Make sure it's CHECKED** ‚úì

7. **Click "Save"** or "OK" at the bottom

**What does this do?**
- As you type code, Roblox will suggest what to write next!
- It's like autocomplete on your phone!
- It helps prevent typos!

---

### SCRIPT #1: Disappearing Platform

Let's make that yellow platform disappear when you step on it!

#### Step 1: Find Your Yellow Platform

1. **Look on the RIGHT side** of Studio

2. **Find a window that says "Explorer"** at the top
   - If you don't see it: Click "View" ‚Üí "Explorer"

3. **In Explorer**, look for **"Workspace"**
   - Click the little arrow next to it to expand it

4. **Find your yellow platform** in the list
   - It might be called "Part" with a yellow square next to it
   - **Click on it** to select it

**üí° Can't find it?** Click on the yellow platform in your 3D view first, then look in Explorer!

#### Step 2: Add a Script to the Platform

Now we're going to put code INSIDE the platform!

1. **Right-click on your yellow platform** in Explorer
   - Make sure you right-click IN the Explorer window

2. **A menu pops up** - Look for **"Insert Object"**
   - Click it!

3. **A search box appears**
   - Type: `script`
   - **Click on "Script"** when you see it

4. **A new "Script" appears** under your platform in Explorer!
   - It looks like a piece of paper with lines on it

**What just happened?** You added a script (code) to your platform! Now let's write the code!

#### Step 3: Open the Script

1. **In Explorer**, find the "Script" you just added
   - It's under your yellow platform

2. **Double-click the Script**

**A new window opens** showing code!

You'll see something like this already written:
```
print("Hello world!")
```

#### Step 4: Delete That and Write Our Code

1. **Select ALL the text** in the script window
   - Press **Ctrl+A** (Windows) or **Command+A** (Mac)
   - Everything turns blue (selected)

2. **Press Delete**
   - Now it's blank!

3. **Now carefully type this code:**

(Type it EXACTLY as shown - capital letters matter!)

```lua
local part = script.Parent
local originalTransparency = part.Transparency
local originalCanCollide = part.CanCollide

part.Touched:Connect(function(hit)
    if hit.Parent:FindFirstChild("Humanoid") then
        wait(0.5)
        part.Transparency = 1
        part.CanCollide = false
        wait(3)
        part.Transparency = originalTransparency
        part.CanCollide = originalCanCollide
    end
end)
```

**üí° IMPORTANT TIPS WHILE TYPING:**
- **Let Code Assist help you!** As you type, suggestions will pop up - press Tab or Enter to accept them!
- **Capitalization matters!** `Transparency` is NOT the same as `transparency`
- **Don't forget semicolons, colons, and parentheses!**
- **Take your time!** It's okay if it takes 5 minutes!

#### Step 5: Understanding What You Just Wrote

Let me explain what each line does:

**Line 1:** `local part = script.Parent`
- This says "Find the platform that this script is inside"
- `script.Parent` means "the thing I'm inside of" (the yellow platform)

**Lines 2-3:** Saving the original settings
- We remember what the platform looked like at the start
- So we can restore it later!

**Line 5:** `part.Touched:Connect(function(hit)`
- This says "When something touches this platform..."
- `Touched` means something touched it
- `function(hit)` means "do the following things"

**Line 6:** `if hit.Parent:FindFirstChild("Humanoid") then`
- This checks "Is it a PLAYER that touched it?"
- `Humanoid` is what makes your character a player
- Prevents random objects from triggering it

**Line 7:** `wait(0.5)`
- Wait half a second before disappearing
- Gives player time to stand on it

**Line 8:** `part.Transparency = 1`
- Make the platform invisible!
- 1 = fully transparent (invisible)
- 0 = fully visible

**Line 9:** `part.CanCollide = false`
- Make it so players fall through it
- `false` means you can't stand on it anymore

**Line 10:** `wait(3)`
- Wait 3 seconds before bringing it back

**Lines 11-12:** Restore the platform
- Make it visible and solid again
- So another player can use it!

**Line 13:** `end`
- This closes the `if` statement

**Line 14:** `end)`
- This closes the `function`

**Every `if` and `function` needs an `end`!**

#### Step 6: Save the Script

**IMPORTANT:** Click anywhere in the script and press **Ctrl+S** (Command+S)!

#### Step 7: Close the Script Window

Click the **X** on the script tab to close it and go back to your 3D view.

#### Step 8: TEST IT!

1. **Click Play** (‚ñ∂)

2. **Walk to the yellow platform**

3. **Step on it!**

**What should happen:**
- You step on the yellow platform
- After 0.5 seconds, it disappears!
- You fall!
- After 3 seconds, the platform comes back!

**DID IT WORK?!** üéâ **YOU JUST WROTE YOUR FIRST CODE!**

#### If It Didn't Work:

**Look for error messages:**
1. Click **"View"** at the top
2. Click **"Output"**
3. A window opens at the bottom showing error messages (in red)

**Common errors:**

**"Expected 'end' near <eof>"**
- You're missing an `end` somewhere
- Count your `if`s and `function`s
- Each needs a matching `end`

**"Attempt to index nil"**
- The script can't find the platform
- Make sure the script is INSIDE the platform in Explorer

**Script does nothing at all:**
- Check Properties: Is "Disabled" UNCHECKED?
- Make sure you saved it (Ctrl+S)
- Make sure it's in the right platform

**If you see errors:** Copy the exact error message and ask ChatGPT or Claude: "I got this Roblox error: [paste error]. Here's my code: [paste code]. What's wrong?"

---

### SCRIPT #2: Moving Platform

Now let's make that blue platform move back and forth!

#### Step 1: Find Your Blue Platform

1. **In Explorer**, find your blue platform
2. **Click on it** to select it

#### Step 2: Add a Script

1. **Right-click** the blue platform in Explorer
2. **Insert Object** ‚Üí **Script**
3. **Double-click** the new Script

#### Step 3: Delete Default Code and Type This:

```lua
local part = script.Parent
local startPosition = part.Position
local endPosition = startPosition + Vector3.new(20, 0, 0)
local speed = 2

while true do
    part:TweenPosition(endPosition, "Out", "Sine", speed, true)
    wait(speed)
    part:TweenPosition(startPosition, "Out", "Sine", speed, true)
    wait(speed)
end
```

#### Step 4: Understanding This Code

**Line 1:** `local part = script.Parent`
- Find the platform this script is inside

**Line 2:** `local startPosition = part.Position`
- Remember where the platform starts
- `Position` is where something is in the world

**Line 3:** `local endPosition = startPosition + Vector3.new(20, 0, 0)`
- Calculate where it should move TO
- `Vector3.new(20, 0, 0)` means:
  - **20** studs to the RIGHT (X direction)
  - **0** studs up/down (Y direction)
  - **0** studs forward/back (Z direction)

**Line 4:** `local speed = 2`
- How many seconds it takes to move
- 2 = slow and easy
- 1 = faster
- 5 = very slow

**Line 6:** `while true do`
- Repeat forever!
- `while true` means "keep doing this over and over"

**Line 7:** `part:TweenPosition(endPosition, ...)`
- **Smoothly move** to the end position
- `Tween` means smooth animation (not instant)
- `"Out"` and `"Sine"` control how it moves (smooth)

**Line 8:** `wait(speed)`
- Wait for the movement to finish

**Lines 9-10:** Move back to start
- Same thing but going back to where it started

**Line 11:** `end`
- Closes the `while` loop
- Then it starts the loop again!

#### Step 5: Customizing the Movement

**Want it to move a different direction?**

Change Line 3:

```lua
-- Move RIGHT:
local endPosition = startPosition + Vector3.new(20, 0, 0)

-- Move LEFT:
local endPosition = startPosition + Vector3.new(-20, 0, 0)

-- Move UP:
local endPosition = startPosition + Vector3.new(0, 20, 0)

-- Move DOWN:
local endPosition = startPosition + Vector3.new(0, -20, 0)

-- Move FORWARD:
local endPosition = startPosition + Vector3.new(0, 0, 20)

-- Move BACKWARD:
local endPosition = startPosition + Vector3.new(0, 0, -20)

-- Move DIAGONALLY (right and up):
local endPosition = startPosition + Vector3.new(20, 10, 0)
```

**Want it faster or slower?**

Change Line 4:

```lua
local speed = 1  -- Faster
local speed = 5  -- Slower
```

#### Step 6: Save and Close

**Press Ctrl+S**, then close the script window!

#### Step 7: TEST IT!

1. **Click Play** (‚ñ∂)

2. **Look at your blue platform** - IT'S MOVING!

3. **Try to jump on it while it's moving!**

**Is it working?** üéâ **AWESOME!**

#### If It's Not Working:

**Platform falls down?**
- Select the platform
- In Properties, check **"Anchored"** ‚úì

**Platform doesn't move?**
- Check the Output window for errors (View ‚Üí Output)
- Make sure you saved the script
- Make sure the script is inside the platform

**Platform moves weird?**
- Try different numbers in Vector3.new()
- Make sure all three numbers are there (X, Y, Z)

---

### SCRIPT #3: Win Block (Finish Line!)

Let's make a BIG GREEN BLOCK at the end that says "YOU WON!" when you touch it!

#### Step 1: Create the Win Block

First we need to make the block!

1. **Press Ctrl+P** to make a new Part

2. **Press R** to Scale

3. **Make it BIG!** Like **15 x 15 x 1** (a big wall)

4. **Press M** to Move

5. **Move it** to the END of your obby
   - Stand it upright like a wall
   - Put it where the finish line should be

6. **In Properties**:
   - **BrickColor**: "Bright green"
   - **Material**: "Neon" (makes it glow!)
   - **Anchored**: ‚úì Checked

**Now you have a big glowing green finish line!**

#### Step 2: Add the Script

1. **Right-click** your green win block in Explorer

2. **Insert Object** ‚Üí **Script**

3. **Double-click** the Script

#### Step 3: Type This Code:

```lua
local part = script.Parent

part.Touched:Connect(function(hit)
    local humanoid = hit.Parent:FindFirstChild("Humanoid")
    if humanoid then
        local player = game.Players:GetPlayerFromCharacter(hit.Parent)
        if player then
            local message = Instance.new("Message")
            message.Text = player.Name .. " has escaped the kitchen!"
            message.Parent = workspace
            wait(3)
            message:Destroy()
        end
    end
end)
```

#### Step 4: Understanding This Code

**Line 3:** `part.Touched:Connect(function(hit)`
- When something touches the win block...

**Line 4:** `local humanoid = hit.Parent:FindFirstChild("Humanoid")`
- Check if it's a player

**Line 5:** `if humanoid then`
- If yes, it's a player...

**Line 6:** `local player = game.Players:GetPlayerFromCharacter(hit.Parent)`
- Get the player's information (like their username)

**Line 7:** `if player then`
- If we successfully found the player...

**Line 8:** `local message = Instance.new("Message")`
- Create a new message object
- `Instance.new` means "make a new thing"

**Line 9:** `message.Text = player.Name .. " has escaped the kitchen!"`
- Set what the message says
- `player.Name` is their username
- `..` joins text together
- So if player is "SuperKid123", it says "SuperKid123 has escaped the kitchen!"

**Line 10:** `message.Parent = workspace`
- Show the message on screen!
- `workspace` is the game world

**Line 11:** `wait(3)`
- Keep message on screen for 3 seconds

**Line 12:** `message:Destroy()`
- Remove the message
- `Destroy()` means delete it

**Lines 13-14:** Close the `if` statements

**Line 15:** Close the function

#### Step 5: Save, Close, and TEST!

1. **Save** (Ctrl+S)

2. **Close** the script window

3. **Click Play** (‚ñ∂)

4. **Complete your obby** and touch the green block!

5. **A message appears!** "YourName has escaped the kitchen!"

**IT WORKS!** üéâüéâüéâ

---

### Step 6: Save Your Whole Game!

## üé® PHASE 6: Making It Look AMAZING

**Time Needed:** 30-45 minutes

Your obby works, but it looks kind of boring. Let's make it look like a REAL giant kitchen!

---

### Understanding Decorations

Decorations make your game:
- More fun to look at
- More immersive (feels real)
- More unique (different from other obbies)

We're going to add:
- Giant kitchen items
- Better lighting
- Cool effects

---

### Part 1: Adding Giant Kitchen Props

We'll use the **Toolbox** - a library of FREE models other people made!

#### Step 1: Open the Toolbox

1. **Click "View"** at the top

2. **Click "Toolbox"**

3. **A window appears** on the left side showing lots of models!

**What is the Toolbox?**
- It's like a library of FREE stuff
- Thousands of models you can use
- Made by Roblox and other creators

#### Step 2: Search for Kitchen Stuff

**In the search box** at the top of the Toolbox, type one of these:

- `kitchen`
- `cup`
- `plate`
- `spoon`
- `fork`
- `mug`
- `utensils`
- `food`
- `coffee cup`

**Press Enter** to search!

#### Step 3: Add Models to Your Game

1. **Look at the search results** - lots of kitchen items!

2. **Click on one you like**
   - It appears in your game!
   - Might be small at first

3. **Select it** (click on it)

4. **Press R** to Scale

5. **Make it HUGE!**
   - Drag the handles OUTWARD
   - Make it giant-sized!
   - Remember: You're ant-sized, so everything is HUGE!

6. **Press M** to Move

7. **Position it** near your obby
   - Put it beside the course (not blocking it!)
   - Make it look like a giant kitchen

**üí° Decoration Ideas:**
- Giant coffee mug next to the start
- Huge plate as a resting platform
- Massive spoon leaning against a wall
- Enormous cereal box in the background
- Giant toaster near the finish line

#### Step 4: Add Several Items

Repeat Step 3 for different items:
- Search for different things
- Add 5-10 giant kitchen items
- Space them around your obby
- Make your world look full and interesting!

**üí° Tips:**
- **Don't block the path!** Put decorations to the SIDE
- **Make everything GIANT** - you're supposed to be tiny!
- **Mix different items** - variety looks better
- **If something looks weird**, just delete it and try another!

#### Alternative: Build Your Own!

Don't like the Toolbox models? Build your own!

**Example: Giant Toaster**

1. Make a big rectangular Part (30 x 20 x 15)
2. Color it black or dark grey
3. Add two smaller Parts on top (the toast slots)
4. Color those medium grey
5. Position it near your obby

**You can make:**
- Toaster (rectangles)

   - Type **8** = Morning (soft, golden light)
   - Type **18** = Evening (sunset, orange/pink)
   - Type **0** or **20** = Night (dark, spooky - need to add lights!)

4. **Press Enter** after typing

**What looks best for a kitchen?** Try 14 (afternoon) - bright and clean!

#### Step 3: Add Atmosphere Color

Make the shadows and light more interesting!

**Still in Lighting Properties:**

1. **Find "Ambient"**
   - This is the color of shadows

2. **Click the color box**

3. **Try these:**
   - Slightly blue (for cool kitchen feel)

```

Right after that line, add:
```lua
    part.Sound:Play()
```

So it looks like:
```lua
if player then
    part.Sound:Play()
    local message = Instance.new("Message")
```

**Save and test!** Now when you win, a sound plays!

1. Create a Part
2. Add a Script
3. Use this code:

```lua
local part = script.Parent
local speed = 50

while true do
    part.CFrame = part.CFrame * CFrame.Angles(0, math.rad(speed * 0.01), 0)
    wait(0.01)
end
```

**What it does:** Slowly spins the platform around!

    if humanoid then
        local player = game.Players:GetPlayerFromCharacter(hit.Parent)
        if player then
            local gui = player.PlayerGui
            local screenGui = Instance.new("ScreenGui", gui)
            local textLabel = Instance.new("TextLabel", screenGui)
            textLabel.Size = UDim2.new(0, 200, 0, 50)
            textLabel.Position = UDim2.new(0.5, -100, 0, 10)
            textLabel.BackgroundTransparency = 1
            textLabel.TextSize = 30
            
            for i = timeLimit, 0, -1 do
                textLabel.Text = "TIME: " .. i
                wait(1)
            end
            
            screenGui:Destroy()
        end
    end
end)
```

        humanoid.Health = 0
    end
end)
```

**Touch red = instant death!**

#### 7. **Conveyor Belt**

A platform that pushes you in one direction!

    wait(2)
    part.Size = smallSize
    wait(2)
end
```

**Platform grows and shrinks!**

## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING - Fixing Common Problems

### Problem: "My script doesn't work!"

**Step 1: Check the Output Window**

1. Click **View** ‚Üí **Output**
2. Look for **RED text** (errors)
3. Read what it says!

**Common Errors:**

**"Expected 'end' near <eof>"**
- **What it means:** You're missing an `end` somewhere
- **How to fix:** 
  - Count your `function`s and `if`s
  - Each needs a matching `end`
  - Look at the line number in the error

**"Attempt to index nil with..."**
- **What it means:** The script can't find something
- **How to fix:**
  - Make sure the script is in the right place
  - Check spelling of object names
  - Is the object actually there?

**"Syntax error"**
- **What it means:** You typed something wrong
- **How to fix:**
  - Check for typos
  - Check capital letters (Lua is case-sensitive!)
  - Make sure all parentheses match: ( )
  - Make sure all quotes match: " "

**"Script timeout"**
- **What it means:** Your script is stuck in an infinite loop with no wait
- **How to fix:**
  - Add `wait()` inside `while true do` loops
  - Never do `while true do` without a `wait()`!

**If you still can't fix it:**
- Copy the error message
- Copy your code
- Ask ChatGPT or Claude: "I got this Roblox error: [error]. Here's my code: [code]. What's wrong?"

---

### Problem: "Parts keep falling down!"

**Why it happens:** Parts aren't anchored!

**How to fix:**

1. **Click on the falling part**
2. **Look at Properties**
3. **Find "Anchored"**
4. **Check the box** ‚úì

**Quick fix for ALL parts:**
1. Press Ctrl+A (selects everything)
2. In Properties, check "Anchored"
3. Everything is now anchored!

---

### Problem: "Players fall through platforms!"

**Why it happens:** CanCollide is off OR they're not anchored

**How to fix:**

1. **Select the platform**
2. **In Properties check:**
   - **Anchored**: ‚úì Checked
   - **CanCollide**: ‚úì Checked

**If still falling through:**
- The platform might be too thin
- Make it at least 0.5 studs thick (change Size)

---

### Problem: "I can't find my part!"

**Ways to find lost parts:**

**Method 1: Use Explorer**
1. Open Explorer (View ‚Üí Explorer)
2. Look in Workspace
3. All your parts are listed there
4. Click on it to select it

**Method 2: Focus on it**
1. Select it in Explorer

3. Camera zooms to it!

**Method 3: Name your parts!**
- Select a part
- In Properties, find "Name"
- Give it a clear name like "JumpPlatform1"
- Easier to find later!

---

### Problem: "Checkpoints don't work!"

**Why it happens:** TeamColors aren't set up correctly

**How to fix:**

1. **Check your starting spawn:**
   - Is its TeamColor set? 
   - If yes, write down the color

2. **Check your checkpoint:**
   - Is its TeamColor DIFFERENT from the start?
   - Each checkpoint needs a UNIQUE color!

3. **Make sure these are set:**
   - **Enabled**: ‚úì Checked
   - **CanCollide**: Unchecked (no ‚úì)
   - **Neutral**: Unchecked (no ‚úì)

4. **Test it:**
   - Walk through checkpoint
   - Jump off and die
   - Do you respawn at checkpoint?

---

### Problem: "My game is laggy/slow!"

**Why it happens:** Too many parts or scripts

**How to fix:**

2. Look at "Parts" number
3. If over 1000, you have too many!
4. Delete unnecessary decorations
5. Combine multiple parts into Models

**Method 2: Optimize scripts**
- Don't use `wait()` with very small numbers
- `wait(0.01)` in a loop = laggy!
- Use `wait(0.1)` or bigger

**Method 3: Check decorations**
- Toolbox models often have hidden parts
- Select a model and look in Explorer
- Delete extra parts you don't need

**Method 4: Test settings**
- In Roblox settings, lower graphics quality
- Turn off shadows
- Close other programs while testing

---

   - Open it (double-click in Explorer)
   - Look for red underlines (errors)
   - Check the Output window for errors

3. **Try this fixed script:**

```lua
local part = script.Parent
local startPos = part.Position
local endPos = startPos + Vector3.new(20, 0, 0)
local speed = 2

while true do
    part:TweenPosition(endPos, Enum.EasingDirection.Out, Enum.EasingStyle.Sine, speed, true)
    wait(speed)
    part:TweenPosition(startPos, Enum.EasingDirection.Out, Enum.EasingStyle.Sine, speed, true)
    wait(speed)
end
```

4. **Make sure the script is:**
   - Inside the platform (check Explorer)
   - Not disabled (in Properties, "Disabled" should be unchecked)

### How to Help Your Child

**Sit Together (Especially at First):**
- Be there for the first 3-5 sessions
- You don't need to understand everything

   - "What does that error say?"

2. **Work through it together:**
   - Read the tutorial together
   - Search YouTube together
   - Use ChatGPT together to debug

3. **Know when to help directly:**
   - Stuck for 10+ minutes = offer help

   - Completely lost = work through step-by-step

**Celebrate Everything:**
- "You made your first platform!"
- "The script worked - great job debugging!"
